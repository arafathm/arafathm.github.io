I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Image, Informatics & Intelligence (i3) Research Lab](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/i3-lab/team){:target="_blank"} of [Prof. Yangming Ou](https://scholar.harvard.edu/yangming.ou){:target="_blank"} at Harvard Medical School [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html){:target="_blank"}, Boston, Massachusetts. My research interests lie in machine/deep learning and its application to medical image analysis. 

I also worked as Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Medical Image Analysis Lab (MIAL)](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/){:target="_blank"} of [Prof. Ghassan Hamarneh](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/people/faculty/ghassanhamarneh.html){:target="_blank"} at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html){:target="_blank"}, Burnaby, BC, Canada.

I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Rafeef Garbi](https://bisicl.ece.ubc.ca/rafeef/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://bisicl.ece.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"}, Vancouver. In my Ph.D. project, I primarily focused on kidney cancer detection and analysis in CT using deep learning. I also completed my M.A.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Rafeef Garbi and [Prof. Antony Hodgson](https://mech.ubc.ca/antony-hodgson/){:target="_blank"} at UBC, Vancouver. My M.A.Sc. project focused on robust bone boundary localization in ultrasound to facilitate minimally invasive ultrasound-guided orthopedic surgery.

Before joining UBC, I completed M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/){:target="_blank"}. During my M.Sc., I worked as a Research Engineer under the supervision of [Prof. Md Kamrul Hasan](http://khasan.buet.ac.bd/){:target="_blank"}, and developed novel ultrasound elastography techniques for breast cancer detection. I also worked as a Software Engineer in the [Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd){:target="_blank"} after completing my B.Sc. degree.
