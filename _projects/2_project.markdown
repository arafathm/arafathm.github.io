Kidney clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the major sub-type of RCC, constituting one the most common cancers worldwide accounting for a steadily increasing mortality rate with 350,000 new cases recorded in 2012. Understanding the underlying genetic mutations in ccRCC provides crucial information enabling malignancy staging and patient survival estimation thus plays a vital role in accurate ccRCC diagnosis, prognosis, treatment planning, and response assessment. Although the underlying gene mutations can be identified by whole genome sequencing of the ccRCC following invasive nephrectomy or kidney biopsy procedures, recent studies have suggested that such mutations may be noninvasively identified by studying image features of the ccRCC from Computed Tomography (CT) data. Such image feature identification currently relies on laborious manual processes based on visual inspection of 2D image slices that are time-consuming and subjective. We proposed a convolutional neural network approach for automatic detection of underlying ccRCC gene mutations from 3D CT
volumes. We aggregate the mutation-presence/absence decisions for all the ccRCC slices in a kidney into a robust singular decision that determines whether the interrogated kidney bears a specific mutation or not. When validated on clinical CT datasets of 267 patients from the TCIA database, our method detected gene mutations with 94% accuracy.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>

<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
```
